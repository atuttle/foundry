#Array Object
If you have ever used Array's in JavaScript, this is an implementation of the JS Array Object.

It's not 100% yet, but contains a lot of the basic functionality from JS arrays.

To use it, just do this: `myArr = new foundry.core.ArrayObj(['test1','test2','test3']);`

More info to come.
